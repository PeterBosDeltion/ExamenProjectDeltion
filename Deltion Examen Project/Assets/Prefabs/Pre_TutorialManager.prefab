  - Welcome to space marine bootcamp! Press W, A, S and D to move around.
  - Great! You can move the mouse to look around.
  - Shoot your gun with left mouse button.
  - This is where you can find important information about your current weapon, health,
    ammo, abilities and ultimate ability. Try reloading your weapon by pressing "R".
  - This image represents your current weapon and how much ammunition is in your
    magazine. All guns have infinite ammunition but need to be reloaded when the
    magazine is empty. Now try switching weapons using your Scroll Wheel or by pressing
    "Q".
  - This bar is your health. If it reaches 0, you will go down. Please walk into
    the red damage matrix to demonstrate.
  - As you can see, taking damage will deplete the bar. Now move into the green healing
    matrix to recover your health.
  - These icons represent your abilities. You can activate them by pressing 1, 2,
    3 or 4. Try using your first ability (1).
  - As you can see when you use an ability its icon gets greyed out and starts slowly
    filling back up. This is because the ability is on cooldown. After the cooldown
    is over it can be used again.
  - This is your ultimate ability. It can be used after gaining enough charge from
    shooting enemies. Charge and activate it by shooting the dummy enemy and pressing
    "F" or "5".
  - Ultimates are very powerful but have limited availability. Use them wisely! One
    last thing, in some levels you may find objects you can interact with by walking
    up to them and pressing "E". Try interacting with the orange pillar.
  - Now you know all you will need, get out there and kill some bugs! Click the "Main
    Menu" button on the bottom right of the screen to leave the tutorial.

  description: 'Consumer reviews for this weapon usually state things such as "1/5
    Terrible ammo economy", "2/5 Alright gun, terrible ammo management". Because
    of these reviews the weapon''s price has plummeted to such low levels, that it
    was introduced to the space marine arsenal "Just because".


    It boasts an
    impressive firerate, at the cost of damage, stability and magazine size. Even
    though it suffers these issues, it is still a very capable *very* short-range
    bug killing machine.'

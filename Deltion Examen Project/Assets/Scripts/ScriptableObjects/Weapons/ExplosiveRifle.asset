  description: 'Using advanced technology stolen from another spacefaring empire,
    this slow firing assault rifle fires special bullets that explode upon contact
    with an enemy. The resulting explosion hurts everything in an area around the
    point of impact.

    Somehow this was deemed safe to use and introduced to the
    space marine arsenal.'
